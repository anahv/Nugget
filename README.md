# Nugget
Nugget is an iOS app that lets you record notes and images, so you can be reminded of them in the future. 

You can create a new nugget, add text and an optional image.

The reminder is set to some time in 3 to 9 months by default, so you don't have to do any extra configuration. If you like, you can change the frequency to anything between 1 month to a year.

At that point, you will receive a local notification with a preview of your nugget, including an image thumbnail (if there is one). 

If you tap on the notification, the app will open at that particular nugget page. 

The app includes all the usual CRUD capabilities, using Apple CoreData. It also has a searchbar so you can search for your nugget. 

With Nugget, never forget a nugget of wisdom again!
